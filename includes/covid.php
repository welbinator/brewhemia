<p class="bold">Do you still offer catering?  </p>
<p>Yes, we can still deliver breakfast or boxed lunches to your office! Email info@brewhemia.com</p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">Will you answer if I call? </p>
<p>Yes</p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">What are precautions you are taking?</p>
<p>Sanitizing all surfaces immediately after use and in regular intervals throughout the day.</p>
<p>Gloves/Masks internally. </p>
<p>Minimal staffing (3 employees maximum).  </p>
<p>No contact sanitized vestibule pick up with hand sanitizer dispenser upon entry.  </p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">What's with the current limited menu?</p>
<p>We currently don’t have a barista staffed during the day but have a few bulk coffee drinks in half gallons.  </p>
<p>We were fully closed for a couple weeks and reopened our  kitchen to serve you.  All of this is new and changes all the time!</p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">What are the protocols for pick up?  </p>
<p>Pull up to front door on 3rd Street. Enter the vestibule (the door is already open) and grab the bag with your name on it.  Give us a wave and a smile through the glass :) </p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">What about drink orders?  </p>
<p>Temporarily only by the half gallon (enough to get your brewhemia fix for a couple days) </p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">Are there other fees?</p>
<p>No</p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">Should I tip?</p>
<p>Yes</p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">Why is it important that Brewhemia stay open? Why not close and wait it out?</p>
<p>Reality: We have bills to pay.  We also really really want to stay connected to our customers. </p><br><hr>

<p class="bold">Bulk Coffee Drinks: </p>
<p>Without a barista on the schedule we still make a mean line of Cold Brew beverages”: Classic cold brew, Thai coffee and our famous Bohemian are offered in an Economy size for you to enjoy from your place of confinement. </p> <br><hr> 

<p class="bold">About Single Serving Coffee</p>
<p class="bold">We currently aren’t doing single coffee beverages for a couple of reasons: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>our baristas are staying safe at home.</li>
    <li>B)  We are trying to reduce the number of small transactions to reduce touch points.  </li>
    </ul><br><hr>

    <p>Sincere Thank You, <br>

    <p>Steve & Andrea Shriver, Matt Danielson and the entire Brew Crew. </p><br>

    <p>Have The Best Day! </p>
